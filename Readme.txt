PokerPad, originally developed by Xanderz
This version contains changes from the following 2+2 posters:
- Donkey111 (Party Poker/Modern Style/Real Money Cash games)
- xor (original work on iPoker)
- Brother Love (numerous bug fixes for iPoker and Party)

The script requires AutoHotKey (NOT AutoHotKey_L) then run "PokerPad.ahk".
Or simply run "PokerPad.exe" if you do not wish to install AutoHotKey.
In order to work with iPoker, the chat window neeeds to be maximised.
Note that there is also a small chance that the colour codes under the section Titan in PokerPad.ini needs changing in order to work with your particular room.
